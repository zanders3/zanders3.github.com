description: This third post describes how to go beyond 512 bytes and how to compile and load a C++ function into memory
---

In our [previous article](/2017/10/16/writing-a-bootloader2/) we got our CPU into 32-bit protected mode and printed the screen using the directly mapped VGA memory. This time we're going to compile and load a C++ function into memory and call it!

Going beyond 512 bytes
----------------------

The BIOS only loads the first 512 bytes of the bootsector. If we want to write programs larger than 512 bytes (maybe you don't want to and like a challenge?) we're going to have to load more off the disk. To do this we're going to use the `int 0x13` [interrupts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_13H) which provide disk services.

The `ah=0x2 int 0x13` command reads sectors from a drive to a target location, like this:

	mov ah, 0x2    ;read sectors
	mov al, 1      ;sectors to read
	mov ch, 0      ;cylinder idx
	mov dh, 0      ;head idx
	mov cl, 2      ;sector idx
	mov dl, [disk] ;disk idx
	mov bx, copy_target;target pointer
	int 0x13

The disk number is implicitly placed into `dl` by the BIOS on startup. Earlier on we stashed it into memory with `mov [disk], dl`.

So we can now load 512 bytes from the second sector into memory! Let's make use of that and move the hello world printing code from [last time](/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/boot2.asm) beyond the first 512 bytes of disk. Like this:

	times 510 - ($-$$) db 0
	dw 0xaa55
	copy_target:
	bits 32
		hello: db "Hello more than 512 bytes world!!",0
	boot2:
		mov esi,hello
		mov ebx,0xb8000
	.loop:
		lodsb
		or al,al
		jz halt
		or eax,0x0F00
		mov word [ebx], ax
		add ebx,2
		jmp .loop
	halt:
		cli
		hlt
	times 1024 - ($-$$) db 0

The last line pads our bootloader to 1024 bytes so we're not copying uninitialised bytes from disk. It's probably easiest to download [boot3.asm](/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/boot3.asm) directly. You can compile and run it with `nasm -f bin boot3.asm -o boot.bin && qemu-system-x86_64 -fda boot.bin` getting this result:

![Hello more than 512 bytes world](/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/boot3.png)

Getting to C++
--------------

Next we're going to load a C++ function that prints Hello world into memory and then call it from the bootloader. Here is the C++ function we want to compile:

	extern "C" void kmain()
	{
		const short color = 0x0F00;
		const char* hello = "Hello cpp world!";
		short* vga = (short*)0xb8000;
		for (int i = 0; i<16;++i)
			vga[i+80] = color | hello[i];
	}

I've intentionally kept the function as simple as possible - it does almost the same thing as the assembly code. The `extern "C"` prevents C++ from [name mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C.2B.2B) the function allowing us to call it from assembly.

Compiling and Linking
---------------------

We now need to compile and link this function. To do this safely we need to create a [cross compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler) - this is safer than using your system's C++ compiler since we can be certain about what instruction set and function call method the compiler uses. I also can't for the life of me convince clang to use a linker script and stop adding loads of OSX specific stuff. Since we're building a 32 bit operating system we also want the compiler to output 32 bit instructions - not 64 bit ones!

Compiling a cross compiler is an absolute pain - but luckily I've hacked a [homebrew tap](https://github.com/zanders3/homebrew-gcc_cross_compilers) you can use:

	brew tap zanders3/homebrew-gcc_cross_compilers
	brew install --debug i386-elf-gcc

Interestingly upgrading Mac OSX can mess gcc and all sorts of things up so try these commands if things fall over.

	xcode-select --install
	brew reinstall gcc

This will install `i386-elf-_g++` on your path which will compile and link stuff for us! Installing takes a while - you might want to grab a cuppa whilst it compiles.

Linker Script
-------------

We need to tell gcc how to link our cpp file and asm files together. We want the `boot4.asm` code positioned at offset `0x7c00` so that the 510th bytes equal `0xAA55` which makes it a valid bootsector. We then want all of the C++ code placed after that in the file.

	ENTRY(boot)
	OUTPUT_FORMAT("binary")
	SECTIONS {
		. = 0x7c00;
		.text :
		{
	        *(.boot)
			*(.text)
		}
	    .rodata :
	    {
	    	*(.rodata)
	    }
	    .data :
	    {
	    	*(.data)
	    }
	    .bss :
	    {
	    	*(.bss)
	    }
	}

The `ENTRY(boot)` means the entry point of the program is the `boot` symbol. `OUTPUT_FORMAT("binary")` tells `gcc` to output raw assembly directly. It will otherwise output a binary file in [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format). The `. = 0x7c00` tells it to start outputting code at that offset, similar to the `org 0x7c00` command.

Calling C++ from Assembly
-------------------------

Next we need to modify our assembly so it can be linked with `gcc`. First we're going to put everything in the `.boot` section so it's placed first as well as define a global `boot:` symbol so the linker knows about the entry point.

	section .boot
	bits 16
	global boot
	boot:

Next we'll hack the disk reading function call to load more than one sector:

	mov al, 6      ;sectors to read

Finally we set up a call stack for C++ to use and call the actual function. We reserve 16 KB for a kernel call stack.

	mov esp,kernel_stack_top
	extern kmain
	call kmain
	cli
	hlt
	section .bss
	align 4
	kernel_stack_bottom: equ $
		resb 16384 ; 16 KB
	kernel_stack_top:

That's it. We're ready to compile and run this thing! Here are my versions of [the linker script](/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/linker.ld), [cpp file](/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/kmain.cpp) and [bootsector assembly](/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/boot4.asm)!

Compiling and Running
---------------------

You want to compile the assembly, then link it all together.

	nasm -f elf32 boot4.asm -o boot4.o
	i386-elf-_g++ x86_64-elf-g++ -m64 kmain.cpp boot4.o -o kernel.bin -nostdlib -ffreestanding -std=c++11 -mno-red-zone -fno-exceptions -nostdlib -fno-rtti -Wall -Wextra -Werror -T linker.ld

We can run `hexdump kernel.bin` to check it did the right thing:

Note the `55 aa` there near offset `0x200`? That means it's a valid bootsector! Let's try running it with `qemu-system-x86_64 -fda kernel.bin` and you should get this result.

Wrapping Up
-----------

That concludes this tutorial series! I hope this was useful to you.

There many more interesting low level things to explore such as setting up [virtual memory](http://wiki.osdev.org/Paging), handling [interrupts](http://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupts) and writing your very own memory allocator! I hope to start exploring these in the future.
