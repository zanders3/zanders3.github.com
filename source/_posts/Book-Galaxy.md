Book Galaxy was my winning entry in the [JISC MOSIAC Developer Competition](http://www.sero.co.uk/jisc-mosaic-competition.html) which challenged entrants to visualise library usage data and library books in an interesting new way. You can view [a demo of it here](/bookgalaxy) and the [source code](http://bookgalaxy.sourceforge.net/) is available on source forge.
