Hi there!

I've taken the time to update my website again. This time I've kept the theme the same (so hopefully you won't notice that too much has changed) but I've moved away from an [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) based site to a static one built using [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). This should make adding new articles and portfolio bits much easier!

I'm going to go through all of the old portfolio and stuff and write some nice detailed articles about all of the cool tech that I've been messing around with.
