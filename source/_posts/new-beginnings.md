Hi there!

I've taken the time to update my website again. This time I've kept the theme the same (so hopefully you won't notice that too much has changed) but I've moved away from an [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) based site to a static one built using [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). This should make adding new articles and portfolio bits much easier!

I've gone through all of my old portfolio stuff and cleaned it up and tidied everything up a bit. Have a look around!
