Hi there!

I think the time has come for me to start writing my own blog. I plan to talk about the various projects that I'm working on, and maybe how to solve particularly tricky problems I've come across.

The first thing I'm going to be blogging about will be [GLWT](https://github.com/zanders3/glwt) the OpenGL Window Toolkit; a project I've only just started working on. More about that to follow! :)
