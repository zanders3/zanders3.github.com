New Beginnings
==============

Hi there!

I think the time has come for me to start writing my own blog. Be warned - it's probably gonna get pretty technical and I'm going to be talking about the various projects that I'm working on! 

The first thing I'm going to be blogging about will be [GLWT](https://github.com/zanders3/glwt) the OpenGL Window Toolkit; a project I've only just started working on. More about that to follow! :)
